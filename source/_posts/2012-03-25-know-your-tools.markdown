I find that reading code from other developers and watching them
work helps improve my approach to problems and techniques I use
in my own projects.
Over the last week,
I have been watching the Play by Play videos on PeepCode. One thing
that stood out while watching these videos was how well the
developers knew the toolset that they were using. This made me
rethink how well I know the tools that I use and how I could
improve my knowledege to gain efficencies.

For example, in the Tenderlove play by play, Aaron shows how well
he knows Ruby, Vim and his shell. He uses these tools to stop him
having to remember specific library calls, or how a particular method
is used. He is able to quickly look up anything that he is unsure of.
Knowing that there is a way to to achieve something or the general
concept is enough; a superior knowledge of the tools ensures that
the answer to any question is found quickly.

I like this method of working. Being focused on the outcome of a task
is much more important than remembering a whole lot of library
calls. This is especially true when working in a pair. Gaps in
library knowledge can be picked up the other person in the pair,
but to reach maximum effiency a good knowledge of the tools being
used it required.

Over the past few months, I have done the following things to improve
the knowledge of the tools that I used everyday and in turn improve
my productivity.

### Learned how to touch type
This was a big gain in productivity.
I thought that I was a reasonably good typist until I measured my
skills with a typing trainer and found that I made a lot of
mistakes and could only manage an effective speed of around 30
words per minute. After around 2 weeks, I was typing at almost
50 words per minute with 99% accuracy. I am not sure that this is
enough but it was certainly a big improvement.

### Customised my Vim setup and learned more about Vim concepts
I started out by reading about how others had started to use Vim.
I then updated my .vimrc with the things that I thought would apply
to my situation. I also installed some plugins relevant to Ruby and
Rails development.
I started to use Git to manage my Vim configuration which allowed me
to have the same configuration across all development machines.

I think these changes would have resulted in approximately a 2 times
improvement in productivity when using Vim.

I recommend updating your knowledge and improving your skills with
the tools you use the most. The payoff is definately work the
investment.
