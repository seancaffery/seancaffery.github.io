I'm Sean Caffery, I'm currently a [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/) [developer](http://au.linkedin.com/in/seancaffery) at
[Zendesk](http://www.zendesk.com) and formally at [C3 Business Solutions](http://c3businesssolutions.com).

I worked extensively on the data collection
and validation application [Integrity](http://c3integrity.com), making Ruby process
gigabytes of data as quickly as possible.
I
[used](http://git-scm.com/) a [number](http://rubyonrails.org/) of [different](http://cukes.info/)
[technologies](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) to get this done.

I built [Stepdown](https://github.com/seancaffery/step-down) because knowing what
is going on in a large test suite is important. And
[Buildy](https://github.com/seancaffery/buildy) to monitor builds
distributed over local and remote servers.

I use GitHub to manage code and [contribute](https://github.com/seancaffery)
[patches](https://github.com/C3) where I can.
