I'm Sean Caffery, I'm a [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/) [developer](http://au.linkedin.com/in/seancaffery) at
[C3 Business Solutions](http://c3businesssolutions.com).
I work mostly work the data collection
and validation application [Integrity](http://c3integrity.com), making Ruby process
gigabytes of data as quickly as possible. My team
[uses](http://git-scm.com/) a [number](http://rubyonrails.org/) of [different](http://cukes.info/)
[technologies](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) to get this done.
We also do automated [deployments](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano),
and [manage](http://www.vmware.com/) the remote [servers](http://ninefold.com/).

I built [Stepdown](https://github.com/scaffery/step-down) because knowing what
is going on in a large test suite is important.

I use GitHub [manage code](https://github.com/seancaffery) and [contribute](https://github.com/C3)
patches where I can.
